# About My App!
The purpose of this app is to make it fun for the user to learn about penguins while also prioritizing their mental health by taking time to ground themselves and be self-aware of their feelings before jumping straight into exploring the data. As an individual passionate about self-care and mental health, I am excited about the potential this app has to showcase the importance of taking a step back and evaluating oneself before jumping to another task. Too often, we do not listen to our bodies and just choose to work, work, and work even more. The deeper purpose and motivation behind this app I created is to remind users that it is important to live in balance and self-awareness to make for oneself a healthy environment that equips us to put our best foot forward and essentially be a force for good in the world we live in!

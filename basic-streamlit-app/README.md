- Call forth the correct file from the appropriate folder by using the command "cd .\basic-streamlit-app\" to locate the basic-streamlit-app folder. One can ensure they are in this folder by using the command "cd .\basic-streamlit-app\ ls" and this should result in the display of the appropriate folders that are within the basic-streamlit-app folder itself.
- Use the command "streamlit run .\main.py" to run the code specific to the app itself. The result of this should be a display that says "You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser" and there should also be a Local URL link and a Network URL link provided.

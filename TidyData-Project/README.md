# Tidy Data Project: README
## Project Overview
- Goal: Apply the principles of tidy data to clean, transform, and do an exploratory data analysis on a dataset about olympic medalists.
## Tidy Data Principles Overview
1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each value is a cell.
- Most tools in data analytics assume a tidy dataset, as it facilitates aggregating and analyzing data following this standard data structure of a tidy data foundation. Hence, tidy data principles allow for a standard way of organizing values in a dataset, facilitating data exploration and analysis (Wickham, 1).

# PINO-Python-Portfolio
The purpose of this repository is to store the Python projects I create throughout the semester, such as the app I most recently created, "Flippers in the Air like They Just Don't Care!" The purpose of this app is to foster self-awareness and encourage discovery! By inviting users to practice a form of self-reflection prior to engaging with the penguin dataset, it reorients users, reminding them of the valuable relationship between oneself and one's limits. In doing so, the app promotes mental health awareness by means of interaction and education. As I add more to my repository throughout the semester, I will be able to keep my projects organized, and I will easily be able to share them with others to showcase my work, which will be particularly helpful upon entering the workforce. That said, I will use this repository to organize future projects, such as exploratory data analyses, data visualizations, and more app creations! Some ways I hope to do this are by assigning each project to its own folder, as I have done for the creation of my first app. Within each, I hope to create sub-folders to store specific components of distinct projects that I can locate easily to keep my repository organized and accessible!

# PINO-Python-Portfolio
The purpose of this repository is to store any Python projects I create throughout the semester. This will allow me to keep my projects organized and easily share them with others to showcase my work, which will be particularly helpful upon entering the workforce. I will use this repository to organize future projects, such as exploratory data analyses, data visualizations, and models. Some ways I hope to do this are by assigning each project to its own folder. Within each, I hope to create sub-folders to store specific components of distinct projects that I can locate easily. Some ideas I have for sub-folder categories include data, Jupyter noteboooks, code, data visualizations/graphs, and results.

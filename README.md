# PINO-Python Porfolio

## Purpose of Repository
The purpose of this repository is to store the Python projects I create throughout the semester, such as the app I recently created, "Flippers in the Air like They Just Don't Care!," as well as my latest Tidy Data Project!

## About the "Flippers in the Air like They Just Don't Care!" App:

The purpose of the app I created is to foster self-awareness and encourage discovery! By inviting users to practice a form of self-reflection prior to engaging with the penguin dataset, it reorients users, reminding them of the valuable relationship between oneself and one's limits. The app promotes mental health awareness by means of interaction and education. I recently updated the Read.Me for the app I created, transforming it from multiple paragraphs to a more digestible and visually-appealing format!

## About my Tidy Data Project
My latest Tidy Data Project was an opportunity to practice applying the principles of tidy data that I learned to clean, transform, and manipulate an untidy dataset to become a tidy dataset from which I could create various pivot tables and create data visualizations ranging from barplots, swarmplots, heatmaps, and more! I selected a dataset about olympic medalists, as I am passionate about health and wellness! This project complements my overall coding portfolio because it is an opportunity during which I got to practice applying my coding skills to real world scenarios, which was an initial goal of mine when I first created my GitHub Portfolio itself. This project also required that I practice some necessary skills I will need to use for more complicated coding projects I embark on in the future, teaching me the essentiality and importance of maintaining a tidy dataset at all costs!

## NER Streamlit App
The purpose of the NER Streamlit App I created is for users to explore spaCy's Named Entity Recognition with their own custom labels and patterns, as it usess spaCy's EntityRuler to add custom rules so the user can visualize detected entities from the text they input! This project compliments my overall portfolio because it highlights a real-world application of Natural Language Processing and demonstrates my growth in terms of coding skill development and confidence with new material. It also incorporates deployment to the Streamlit Community Cloud, which facilitates sharing projects with others; this was one of my goals for developing my repository since the beginning of the year! This image demonstrates a possible output of a user engaging with the app, highlighting spaCy's NER feature and ability to create visualizations of detected entities with custom patterns and labels:

## Alzheimer's Disease Risk Predictor App
The purpose of the Alzheimer's disease predictor app is to detect risk level based on user input such as sex, age, education level, APOE4 status, and family history to encourage users to make the necessary lifestyle changes to mitigate the changes of the disease coming to fruition. The predictive model underlying this app was trained by a dataset created based on data from the National Institute of Health, increasing the accuracy with which the machine learning model learned to recognize patterns and make predictions from user input based on those learned patterns. The app takes into account these inputs and then outputs either "high" or "low" risk, informing the user how its inputs aligned with the dataset used to train the predictive model. This app relates to my domain of interest (healthcare) because it considers important risk factors for this disease and makes a prediction based on known scientific correlations between said factors and Alzheimer's disease development. I am extremely passionate about this in particular because my grandfather, role model, and inspiration passed away from Alzheimer's disease when I was in high school. He always encouraged me to thrive academically, and I know he is smiling down on me as this app comes to life! This app complements my overall Python Portfolio because it demonstrates my knowledge of interactive Python development and deployment! In creating this app, I used many lines of code to increase the level of interactivity for the user when engaging with the app as well as data visualization tables for them to document their inputs and observe the data underlying the predictive model itself. Additionally, I deployed the app to the Streamlit Community Cloud after running it locally on my internal browser, requiring me to put to use model deployment skills learned over the semester.

## Goals for Developing Repository 
Looking back on this semester, I am proud of my repository development! I kept my projects organized and am now easily able to share my projects with anyone. I am excited to share my disease predictor app with others in the healthcare domain! I look forward to creating more projects to add to my repository in the future, particularly with a focus in healthcare as it relates to that which I am passionate about. Some ideas I have for future projects include exploratory data analyses with large patient datasets, data visualizations for healthcare data collected through the National Institue of Health, and more app creations such as disease predictors for other conditions! I also hope to somehow incorporate exercise and sports with healthcare for the next app I create. In particluar, I am a member of a Sports Biomechanics Research Group here at the University of Notre Dame, and one of our goals for next semester includes creating an app that Notre Dame Athletes can use to get feedback from the research we are conducting on their movement mechanics as well as the influence neuroscientifc factors have on their performance and risk of injury! I look forward to applying all the skills which I learned this semester to my role as a member of the research team next semester, and I will be sure to deploy the app to the Streamlit Community Cloud once it is created so that others can explore my work and gather ideas just as I have done!
